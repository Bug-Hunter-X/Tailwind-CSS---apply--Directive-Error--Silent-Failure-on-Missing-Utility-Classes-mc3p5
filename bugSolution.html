The solution involves carefully checking your Tailwind CSS configuration (`tailwind.config.js`) to ensure that all utility classes used with `@apply` are correctly defined.  Also, use your browser's developer tools to inspect the rendered HTML and ensure the expected classes are present.

Here's how `bug.html` might be corrected:

```html
<!-- bug.html (incorrect) -->
<div class="@apply bg-red-500 text-white">
</div>

<!-- bugSolution.html (correct) -->
<div class="bg-red-500 text-white">
</div>

<!-- OR, if using @apply, make sure bg-red-500 and text-white are defined in your tailwind.config.js -->
<div class="@apply bg-red-500 text-white">
</div>
```

In this example, using `bg-red-500` and `text-white` directly in the class attribute is simpler and avoids potential issues. If you must use `@apply`, verify that the classes exist within your configuration.
